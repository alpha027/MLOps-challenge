# MLOps challenge

This is a small minimal AI inference API for image classification.

## Development Requirements

- Python3.11.0
- Pip
- Poetry (Python Package Manager)

### M.L Model Environment

```sh
MODEL_PATH=./ml/model/
MODEL_NAME=densenet121
```

### Update `/predict`

To update your machine learning model, add your `load` and `method` [change here](app/api/routes/predictor.py#L19) at `predictor.py`

## Installation

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
make install
```

## Runnning Localhost

`make run`

## Deploy app

`make deploy`

## Running Tests

`make test`

## Access Swagger Documentation

## AWS

Deploying inference service to AWS Lambda

### Authenticate

1. Install `awscli` and `sam-cli`
2. `aws configure`

### Deploy to Lambda

1. Run `sam build`
2. Run `sam deploy --guiChange this portion for other types of models

## Add the correct type hinting when completed

`aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <STACK_NAME_ON_CREATION>`
